# KepperApp-React

## A simple note-taking clone of google notes made with React and Material UI.

This project was made by following the lessons from this Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">course</a>


it contains only basic functions: remove and add notes. However, it was my first experience using react. It's helped me a lot to understand the basic of props, components, react hooks, event handling, etc.
